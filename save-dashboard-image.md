# Dashboard Image Setup Instructions

To properly display the dashboard image in the website:

1. Save the dashboard image you shared to this location:
   `/home/it/web/zmillyweb/public/images/dashboard.jpg`

2. The image should be in JPG format and optimized for web display.

3. After saving the image, refresh the browser to see the changes.

Note: The component has been updated to display a single image instead of the coded mockup.
