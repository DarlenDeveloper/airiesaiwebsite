# Dashboard Images Setup Instructions

To properly display the dashboard images in the website, please follow these steps:

1. Save the dashboard images you shared to the following locations:
   - Save the left image (call history) as: `/home/it/web/zmillyweb/public/images/dashboard-calls.jpg`
   - Save the middle image (analytics graph) as: `/home/it/web/zmillyweb/public/images/dashboard-analytics.jpg`
   - Save the right image (overview) as: `/home/it/web/zmillyweb/public/images/dashboard-overview.jpg`

2. You can use any image editing software to crop the single image you shared into three separate images.

3. The images should be in JPG or PNG format and should be optimized for web (recommended size: around 800-1200px width).

4. After saving the images, restart the development server to see the changes.

Note: The placeholder files have already been created at these locations, you just need to replace them with the actual images.
