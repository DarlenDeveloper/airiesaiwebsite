Last Updated: 21|04|2025
Welcome to Airies AI. These Terms of Service (“ToS” or “Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Airies AI platform, including all related services, features, content, and tools (collectively, the “Platform”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use the Platform under any circumstances.

1. Acceptance of Terms
These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you (“User,” “you,” or “your”) and Airies AI (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By registering for an account, accessing, or otherwise interacting with the Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with these Terms and our accompanying Privacy Policy. If you are using the Platform on behalf of a business, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the full authority to bind that entity to these Terms, and “you” will refer to both you and that entity collectively.
We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at our discretion. Should we make material changes, we will notify you through reasonable means, such as via email to the address associated with your account or by displaying a prominent notice on the Platform. Such notifications will be provided at least 30 days prior to the changes taking effect, unless immediate changes are required by law. Your continued use of the Platform following the effective date of any updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically to stay informed of any modifications. If you disagree with the updated Terms, your sole remedy is to discontinue using the Platform and terminate your account prior to the effective date of the changes.
